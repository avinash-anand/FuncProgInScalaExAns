  * EXERCISE 3 (hard): Implement partial1 and write down a concrete usage
  * of it. There is only one possible implementation that compiles. We don't have any
  * concrete types here, so we can only stick things together using the local 'rules of
  * the universe' established by the type signature. The style of reasoning required here
  * is very common in functional programmingâ€”we are simply manipulating symbols
  * in a very abstract way, similar to how we would reason when solving an algebraic
  * equation.
